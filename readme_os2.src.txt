Lynx 2.8 for OS/2 source distribution
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note: this source distribution is a recent lynx development
snapshot; no additional changes have been made for OS/2, as OS/2-EMX
is now (as of Lynx 2.8.1dev13 or so) a supported platform for Lynx.
You can get a more recent development snapshot from
http://sol.slcc.edu/lynx/current/.

Please read README.OS2 for information on the tools you will need to
compile Lynx for OS/2.
